# Manor Mystery
Manor Mystery is a text-based Python game where you are a detective trying to solve the mystery of the murder. This project was an assignment for one of my early Computer Science classes in College. We were tasked to make a dungeon-style game where the player moves from room to room to achieve a goal. 

Here is a crude drawing of the map of the house. Hopefully, it will aid you in the Mystery
